# Finding Common Values in 2 Binary Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

- **Code Challenge 32 - Finding Common Values in 2 Binary Trees**
Today's code challenge was to write a function called `treeIntersection` that takes two binary tree parameters. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees. I wrote a method called `treeIntersection(tree1, tree2)` that takes two binary tree parameters. I will have to write tests for this method, and ensure that all tests are passing.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 32**
I started today's challenge by creating a whiteboard. I then wrote out the code for the `treeIntersection` method. I then wrote tests for the method, but I failed to get my tests to pass. Truthfully, I don't know what the hell is going on with this stuff. It's out of control and I hate it. The Big O for this method is O(n).

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- **Code Challenge 32**
  - To run this code, you will need to clone down the repo from github. Once you have cloned the repo, you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests. All tests should pass. But they won't. Because I am a terrible developer.
