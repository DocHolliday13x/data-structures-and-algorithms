- **Code Challenge 38 - Leaf Weight**
Today's code challenge is a personal pick between my group and I. We chose to write a function called `hasLeafWithWeight()` that takes a `binary search tree` and an `integer` as an argument and should check to see if there exists a leaf whose path weight equals the given integer. If it does, then the function should return `true`, and if it doesn't, the return should read `false`. I will have to write tests for this method, and ensure that all tests are passing.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 38**
We started today's challenge by colloborating on a whiteboard. We then wrote out the code for the `hasLeafWithWeight()` method. I then wrote tests for the method, but I failed to get my tests to pass. Truthfully, I don't know what the hell is going on with this stuff. The Big O for this method is on the whiteboard.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- **Code Challenge 38**
  - To run this code, you will need to clone down the repo from github. Once you have cloned the repo, you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests. All tests should pass. But they won't. Because I am a terrible developer.
