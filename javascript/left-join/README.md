# Finding Common Values in 2 Hashmaps
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

- **Code Challenge 32 - Finding Common Values in 2 Binary Trees**
Today's code challenge was to write a function called `leftJoin`. The function will take two hashmaps as arguments. Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees. The returned data structure we chose to hold the results was up to us, and we chose to return an array. We wrote a method called `leftJoin(map1, map2)` that takes two hashmaps as arguments. I will have to write tests for this method, and ensure that all tests are passing.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 33**
We started today's challenge by colloborating on a whiteboard. We then wrote out the code for the `leftJoin()` method. I then wrote tests for the method, but I failed to get my tests to pass. Truthfully, I don't know what the hell is going on with this stuff. The Big O for this method is on the whiteboard.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- **Code Challenge 33**
  - To run this code, you will need to clone down the repo from github. Once you have cloned the repo, you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests. All tests should pass. But they won't. Because I am a terrible developer.
