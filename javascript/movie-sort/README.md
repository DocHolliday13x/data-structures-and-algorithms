# Sorting: Comparisons
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

**Code Challenge 26 - Insertion Sort**
Today's assignment will not include a whiteboard for the code challenge. This code challenge has two parts:

1. In the first half of this code challenge, you will write functions which sort domain objects. Your functions will receive an array of Movie objects. Each Movie object has a title (string), a year (number), and a list of genres (array of strings). One function will sort the movies by most recent year first. One function will sort the movies, alphabetical by title, but will ignore any leading “A”s, “An”s, or “The”s. Test outputs for these functions, and an array of sample data, have been provided in `test` and `movies`.

2. In the second half of the code challenge, you will write tests for your comparator functions. This may necessitate refactoring the code you wrote in part one. Your tests will need to call the comparator functions directly, and make assertions about the response values given test inputs.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
- **Code Challenge 26**

There was no whiteboard requirement for today's code challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 28**
I started by creating this `movie-sort` file under `JavaScript`, then I imported the starter code from our class repo. I had to install testing dependencies, and then write the functions to pass the provided tests.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- **Code Challenge 28**
  - To run this code, you will need to clone down the repo from github. Once you have cloned the repo, you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests. All tests should pass.
