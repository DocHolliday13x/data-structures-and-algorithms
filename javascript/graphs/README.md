# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

- **Code Challenge 36 - Breadth-First**
Today's code challenge was to write a function called `breadthFirst`. It will take `node` as an argument and should return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. I will have to write tests for this method, and ensure that all tests are passing.

- **Code Challenge 37 - Business Trip**
Today's code challenge was to write a function called `businessTrip`. It will take a graph and an array of city names as arguments. It should return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost. I will have to write tests for this method, and ensure that all tests are passing.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 36**
We started today's challenge by colloborating on a whiteboard. We then wrote out the code for the `leftJoin()` method. I then wrote tests for the method, but I failed to get my tests to pass. Truthfully, I don't know what the hell is going on with this stuff. The Big O for this method is on the whiteboard.

- **Code Challenge 37**
I started off with my whiteboard for today's code challenge. I then wrote out the code for the `businessTrip()` method. I then wrote tests for the method. The Big O for this method is on the whiteboard.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- **Code Challenge 36**
  - To run this code, you will need to clone down the repo from github. Once you have cloned the repo, you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm test` in your terminal to run the tests. All tests should pass. But they won't. Because I am a terrible developer.

Surely they won't though because I haven't a god damned clue as to what I'm doing anymore. My mind is adrift in a sea of doubt.
