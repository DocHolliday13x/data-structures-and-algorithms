**Code Challenge 26 - Insertion Sort**
Today's assignment will include a whiteboard of the code challenge. The code challenge is to write a function that takes in an array and sorts it using the insertion sort method. The insertion sort method is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by iterating through the array and comparing the current index to the previous index. If the current index is less than the previous index, the current index is swapped with the previous index. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. The Big O space/time for this approach is O(n^2). We have been provided psuedo code for this code challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- **Code Challenge 26**
I started by colloborating on a whiteboard with Reece Renninger. Our whiteboard is embedded above. After being provided the psuedo code from the code challenge, we were able to write the code in a short amount of time. We then wrote the tests and passed all of them. The Big O space/time for this approach is O(n^2).
