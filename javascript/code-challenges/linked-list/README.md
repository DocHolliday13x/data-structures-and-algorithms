# Linked List
<!-- Short summary of the challenge -->
Today's assignment is to create a whiteboard that portrays my process of creating a linked list. I will create a node class that has properties for the value stored within the node, and a pointer to the next node. I will also create a linked list class that has a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach and Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We went through this as a class and discussed the whiteboard process. We also went over Singly Linked Lists and how they work. The Big O space/time for this approach is O(n) because the time it takes to complete the function is directly proportional to the size of the input.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
