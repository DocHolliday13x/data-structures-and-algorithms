  "description": "<!-- Short summary of the challenge --> Today's assignment is to create a whiteboard that portrays my process of creating a linked list and extending an implementation. I will create a node class that has properties for the value stored within the node, and a pointer to the next node. I will also create a linked list class that has a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created. I will then have to write a KTH method for the Linked List class. After both classes have been written out, I'll need some tests to make sure everything is working properly.",
